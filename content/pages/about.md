My name is Travis and I have been involved with open source /
free software in some capacity since around 2002. I mainly started as
a user once I stumbled upon Linux and comparing it to Windows XP;
my main Linux distro of choice then was Mandrake. Later, I started
learning programming and I made some small utilities to solve my own
problems. The two main popular projects that I have made were antimicro
and DS4Windows.

Nowadays, I would rather focus more on AFK activities as opposed to
staring at a computer screen for hours on end.
