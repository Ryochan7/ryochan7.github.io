Hello world. Trying out Pelican SSG for creating a small blog and personal
website. It might be better to have some form of online presence outside
of social media so I want my own small website again.

Using an SSG should work out fine for what functionality I want. I do
not really need to use something like WordPress or Drupal for such a small
website. Pelican SSG has worked out well enough in the past so I figured
I might as well use it again.
