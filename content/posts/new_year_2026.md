Still alive. Quick health update. My recent endoscopy came back clean with only some minor visible throat irritation.

2025 was a pretty bad year for the most part. I am not expecting 2026 to be much better to be honest.
Hopefully I will be a bit more productive and not just wage cuck while ignoring my ambitions.
Anyway, some obligatory New Year's Resolutions. Hopefully I complete at least 50% of them; I only completed
about 42% of my 2025 resolutions.

## Resolutions

1\. Bench 200 lbs.

I can currently bench 190 lbs. so I would think 200 lbs. would be doable pretty early in the year.
That is a very conservative milestone. A bit higher of a goal would be to shoot for 220 lbs. just for the
220 meme (mentally unstable person meme in the DSP detractor circles). Hitting the gym more often
and bumping up the numbers of other moves is also important.

2\. Study Japanese. Maybe take the JLPT N4 test at the end of the year

This has been a failed resolution for at least the past couple of years. I got out of consooming
any form of Japanese language media again. Got too busy with busy work. I knew by August that
there was no way I would be ready to take the JLPT N4 test in December.

3\. Watch Magic Knight Rayearth all the way through

This goes along with studying Japanese more and this is a failed resolution from 2025. Been a passive
fan of the series since I was a teenager and bought a couple VHS tapes of the series. I have never
actually watched the series all the way through though. As a small aside, I think the only Clamp series I have
seen all the way through is Chobits.

4\. Read more paper books. Go to the library more

I started this one at bit last year. I still did not read as much as I originally wanted to.

5\. Try to embark on more controller mapper autism. Play more vidya

In 2025, I barely had the time to play any video games. My two most played games according to Steam in 2025
were Rocksmith 2014 and Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection. Most of that time was around Q4 2025. Between
work, sleep, and trying to do things around uncontrolled acid reflux, there is not much time to veg out
and relax playing video games.

There have only been some small changes I have been able to make with programs. Although I have not played around with
lightgun games in a long time, getting a working version of Square mode working in Touchmote made the output cursor much
easier to configure and more accurate. Some small recent changes to DS4MapperTest really improved the performance of the app
and made the output mouse cursor smoother.

Getting DS4MapperTest moved to a different GUI toolkit would be a decent goal for 2025. Another goal is to finally
make some sort of Wiimote mapper utility built on .NET 8. I do not like having to keep being dependent on the old
Touchmote application that is stuck on .NET Framework. Having an even better lightgun experience would make it somewhat worth
making a small app for a niche controller in the current year.

## End

That is all I have.
