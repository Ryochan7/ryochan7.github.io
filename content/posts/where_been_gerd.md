This will hopefully be a short post. I was mostly offline for several months
due to constant pain I was experiencing. It started off as a stress induced
stomach ulcer. I was getting stomach pains after every meal for over a week.
On 2024/08/06, after dinner, I had an upchucking sensation that would not
stop so I went to the hospital. That night I was diagnosed with GERD and my current
medical journey started. I went to the hospital 5 times that first month
from the pain and also because the meds I was taking then were not really doing
anything for me.

Sometime in late October, I unintentionally overdosed on Betaine HCL
while I was struggling to find a good dose for me to try to stop the acid reflux.
I ended up giving myself gastritis. I waited about a week before I went back
to the hospital due to the pain and out of fear. Gastritis was extremely
painful and I had to consume a lot of aloe vera juice in order to be able
to function at all; sucralfate and coleslaw also helped. It took over 2
and a half months to mostly heal and feel somewhat okay.

I have been somewhat back online since around March. My symptoms are a bit
more under control mostly from diet changes rather than due to PPI usage.
I still expereince throat pain throughout the day and even recently I had
a major stomach acid attack while sleeping. Acid shot up in my mouth and woke me up;
I had teeth work done that day so I could not take some measures I normally would at night.
It is still very hard to focus on anything and my meds put me in a worse
brain fog than I would experience before. I am still waiting to get
an endoscopy done to see how damaged my throat currently is.

That is about it. I am not sure how active I will be anymore.
